## 10. Priority queue
<p align="justify">
Call-by-priority: we hope to visit certain element with a highest priority.

### 10.1 Complete Binary Heap 
<p align="justify">
Complete Binary Tree is special AVl with a non-negative balance factor everywhere. In other word, left subtree is not short than right subtree.<br><br>

Logically: complete binary heap is equal to a complete binary tree<br>
Physically: complete binary heap is equal to a vector<br><br>

If an element's rank is i, its parent (if exists) has a rank of $\frac{i-1}{2}$, its left child (if exists) has a rank of 2i+1, its right child (if exists) has a rank of 2i+2.

</p>

### 10.2 Max heap
<p align="justify">
We define a max heap by $H[i] \leq H[parent(i)]$ for any i > 0. We call this rule heap order. So, the max value must be at root node for a max heap. Similarly, we can define a min heap.
</p>

### 10.3 Insert
<p align="justify">
For any new element e, we insert it at the end of vector. If e $\leq$ parent(e), everything is ok; otherwise, we exchange e and its parent. However, it is possible that e is still bigger than its new parent, so we continue to exchange e and its parent untill heap order is satisfied. Such a method for adjusting is called percolate up.<br><br>

In fact, each we don't need 3 assignments at each swap. We can get a copy of e, until we find some a parent that heap order is satisfied we swap e and this parent.<br><br>

During this process, the complexity for assignment is in $O(logn+2)$.
</p>

### 10.4 DelMax
<p align="justify">
Complete binary heap only support visit the max and remove the max. If we want remove the max e, we exchange e and the last node r then remove e. Obviously, new root r may be samller than its children. In this case, we swap r and r's bigger child between two child. We continue this operation until heap order is respected. We call this process percolate down. Similarly, we can find the last child c and swap c and r.<br><br>

Complexity is in $O(logn)$
</p>

### 10.5 Heapification
<p align="justify">
We have n elements in an array and we want build a heap with them.
</p>

#### 10.5.1 Top-to-Down percolate up
<p align="justify">
We insert all elements at the end of heap by the first one then percolate up to adjust the heap. For worst condition, complexity is in $O(nlogn)$. In fact, we can sort them with such time. So, this way don't saisfy our demand.
</p>
{% highlight C++ %}
void percolateUp(vector<int> &arr, int idx)
{
    int n = int(arr.size());
    if (idx < 0 || idx >= n) { return; }
    while (idx > 0)
    {
        int parIdx = (idx - 1) / 2;
        if (arr[parIdx] > arr[idx])
        {
            swap(arr[parIdx], arr[idx]);
            idx = parIdx;
        }

{
    int n = int(arr.size());
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) { percolateUp(arr, i); }
}
{% endhighlight %}

#### 10.5.2 Down-to-Up percolate down
<p align="justify">
Consider a case: we have two sub-heap $r_{0}$ and $r_{1}$ which are children of p. How to adjust the heap? Answer is percolate dowm p. Besides, we know there are more than 50% nodes are all leaf nodes. So, we only need do this operation for internal nodes. Last internal node's position is $\left \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right \rfloor - 1$. For worst condition, complexity is in $\sum_{i} height(i) = O(n)$.

### 10.6 Leftist Heap
<p align="justify">
Leftist heap is to merge two heaps A and B efficiently.<br><br>

A simple way is A.insert(B.removeMax) in $O(m*(logm+log(n+m))) = O(m*log(m+n))$<br><br>

Another way by Floid Heapification is union(A, B) then heapify(A+B) in $O(n+m)$<br><br>

We seek for a faster way -- Leftist Heap in $O(logn)$<br>
Nodes are inclined to be located at left and nodes to be merge at right.
</p>

#### 10.6.1 Null Path Length
<p align="justify">
We introduce external nodes as null nodes. We define null path length (NPL):<br>
$$
NPL(x) =
\begin{cases}
	0, \quad x \text{is null} \\
	1 + min(NPL(lc(x)), MPL(rc(x))), \quad \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

Where lc(x) is x's left child adn rc(x) is x's right child<br><br>

In fact, if we change min with max, we will get a height of tree.
<center><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chaopan95/chaopan95.github.io/master/_imgs/DSA/NPL_1.png"/></center>
</p>
<p align="justify">
For example, NPL for node 3 is 3.<br><br>

NPL(x) means a minimum distance form x to some external node.<br>
NPL(x) means a tree with x as root has a complete binary tree of a height of NPL(x)
</p>

#### 10.6.2 Leftist Property
<p align="justify">
For any node, NPL(lc(x)) $geq$ NPL(rc(x)), we call this leftist property.
$$NPL(x) = 1 + NPL(rc(x))$$

A heap with leftist property is a leftist heap. We can infer that a leftist heap's sub heap is a leftist heap.
</p>

#### 10.6.3 Right Chain
<p align="justify">
Starting from x, go down always along right sub heap until an external node. We call this path right chain. Obviously, the end of a right chain must be an external node with the smallest NPL.
$$NPL(r) = \left | rChain(r) \right | = d$$

Then, a leftist heap with a right chain of length d must conatin a complete bianry tree of a height d. Furthermore, this leftist heap must contains $2^{d+1}-1$ nodes including $2^{d}-1$ internal nodes.<br><br>

In other word, if we have n nodes in a leftist heap
$$d \leq \left \lfloor log_{2}(n+1) \right \rfloor - 1 = O(logn)$$
</p>

#### 10.6.4 Merge
<p align="justify">
Leftist heap breaks structure of normal heap because of leftist property, so we take use of binary tree to realize leftist heap instead of vector.<br><br>

Suppose we have 2 leftist heaps with root A and B (A > B), we take A's right sub-heap and recursively merge it and B. Then we put the merged heap as A's right sub-heap. If NPL(A's left sub-heap) < NPL(new sight sub-heap), we swap the two.

	a->npl = a->rc?a->rc->npl+1:1;
	return a;
}
{% endhighlight %}

#### 10.6.5 Insert
<p align="justify">
In fact, insert is a merge, becaue we can regard a new node as a leftist heap with only one element.
</p>
{% highlight C++ %}
void PQ_LeftHeap<T>::insert (T e)
{
	BinNodePosi(T) v = new BinNode<T>(e);
	_root = merge(_root, v);
	_root->parent = NULL;
	_size++;
}
{% endhighlight %}

#### 10.6.6 DelMax
<p align="justify">
Similarly, remove is also a merge, because after we remove root node, we only merge its two sub-heap.
</p>
{% highlight C++ %}
void PQ_LeftHeap<T>::delMax ()
{
	BinNodePosi(T) lHeap = _root->lc;
	BinNodePosi(T) rHeap = _root->rc;
	T e = _root->data;
	delete _root;
	_size--;
	_root = merge(lHeap, rHeap);
	if (_root) _root->parent = NULL;
	return e;
