### 9.1 Hash
<p align="justify">
Call-by-rank: Vector<br>
Call-by-position: List<br>
Call-by-key: BST<br>
Call-by-value: Hashing<br><br>

Consider we want to visit some value with a key, an usual way is to use a vector to contain all value. It os easy to call-by-rank. Luckily, this will occupy much ressource. We hope to make use of a small vertor to realize this function. So we introduce hash table (or bucket array) with a lenghth (capacity) of M.<br><br>

Our hash table must be capable of accomodating all value N. At the same time, hash table is much smaller than real key space
$$N < M << R$$

</p>
<p align="justify">
Concretely, we want to search a phone number with 8-digits and we know there is totally 90000 phone numbers. How do we design our searching system? Simply. we can set a vector to contain all possible numbers, say $10^{8}$. Obviously, this occupies much ressources and has a low use rate, because we search 90000 phone numbers but have to spend so much memory (use rate = $\frac{90000}{10^{8}}$). So, we turn to hash table. We set a hash table with a length of 90000 and a hash function
$$hash(key) = key \% 900001$$

If we want to search 62785001, we calculate its remainder by 90001. Then, we can call-by-rank in hash table to acquire the phone number. Apparently, hash highly augment a use rate<br><br>

But, what if two keys (e.g. 51531876 and 62782001) have a same result by hash table? Such a problem is called hash collision.
</p>

### 9.2 Hash function
<p align="justify">
Hash function is map from a key space to hash table, namely hash(): S $\rightarrow $ A. But key value's amount is much bigger than hash table's capacity $\left | S \right | = R >> M = \left| A \right|$, so hash function isn't a single map.<br><br>

What does a good hash function look like?<br>
1) determinism: a same key is always mapped to a same address<br>
2) efficiency: expect $O(1)$<br>
3) surjection: all keys are distributed in the hash table as more as possible<br>
4) uniformity: a uniform probability of mapping one key to hash table in order to avoid clustering<br><br>
</p>

#### 9.2.1 Modulo operation
<p align="justify">
$$hash(key) = key \% M$$

It would be better that M is a prime number. Why? Consider we have a hash table with a length of M, now here is a key S. We focus at their greatest common divisor
$$gcd(S, M) = g$$

We hope g can be uniformly distributed in our hash table for any s. According to number theory, g should be 1. So, M is a prime. 
<center><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chaopan95/chaopan95.github.io/master/_imgs/DSA/hashing_2.png"/></center>
</p>
<p align="justify">
Modulo operation is not perfect, because 0 is always mapped to 0 no matter what M is ($hash(0) \equiv 0$). Besides, if s and s' is near to each other, thier maps are still near. These will break uniformity.
</p>

#### 9.2.2 MAD
<p align="justify">
MAD is multiply-add-divide. We define M by a prime number, with a > 0, b > 0 and a % M $\neq$ 0.
$$hash(key) = (a \times key + b) \% M$$

b is offset to avoid fixed point and a is step to disperse some near points.
</p>

#### 9.2.3 Selecting digits
<p align="justify">
We take some digits (decimal or binary) for a key. For example, we take all odd digits position 1, 3, 5,.. for a decimal number
$$hash(123456) = 246$$
</p>

#### 9.2.4 Mid-square
<p align="justify">
We take some digits in the middle of $key^{2}$. For example, $hash(123) = 15129 = 512$
</p>

#### 9.2.5 Folding
<p align="justify">
We split a key into several parts then sum them. For example,
$$hash(123456789) = 123 + 456 + 789 = 1368$$
</p>

#### 9.2.6 XOR
<p align="justify">
We split a key into several parts with a same width, then have a XOR operation on them. For example,
$$hash(110011011) = 110 \wedge 011 \wedge 011 = 110$$
</p>

#### 9.2.7 Pseudorandom number generator
<p align="justify">
$$hash(key) = rand(key) = (rand(0) \times a^{key}) \% M$$

Different platforms may use different algorithm to generate a random number. So, we shoul take care of compatibility.
</p>

#### 9.2.8 Polynomial
<p align="justify">
$$hash(s = [x_{0}, x_{1}, ..., x_{n-1}]) = x_{0}a^{n-1} + x_{1}a^{n-2} + ... + x_{n-2}a^{1} + x_{n-1}$$

Here is an approximate way that we remplace all multiplication by base convert
</p>
{% highlight C++ %}
static size_t hashCode(char s[])
{
	int h = 0;
	for (size_t n = strlen(s), i = 0; i < n; i++)
	{
		h = (h << 5) | (h >> 27);
		h += (int)s[i];
	}
	return (size_t) h;
}
{% endhighlight %}


### 9.3 Collision resolution
#### 9.3.1 Open hashing
<p align="justify">
For any collision address, we open a chain for them.
<center><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chaopan95/chaopan95.github.io/master/_imgs/DSA/hashing_3.png"/></center>
</p>
<p align="justify">
Pros:<br>
No need to provide in advance some space for any node.<br>
Support endless collision if system permits.<br><br>

Cons:<br>
Extra space for pointer<br>
Dynamic allocation for new node<br>
System cache doesn't work
</p>

#### 9.3.2 Open addressing or Closed hashing
<p align="justify">
Not like open hashing, we prepare in advance several space buckets for all collisions forming a probing sequence/chain. If we want to seach some value, we visit along this probing sequence until we find this value or a empty bucket. How to establish the probing sequence?<br><br>

<b>Linear probing</b><br>
Take modulo for an insatnce, once a collision happens, we turn to its successor
$$\begin{matrix} [hash(key) + 1] \% M \\ [hash(key) + 2] \% M \\ [hash(key) + 3] \% M \\ \vdots \end{matrix}$$

Until we succeed in find it or fail.<br><br>

Closed hashing efficiently take use of current space of hash table instead of allocating new space. Besides, hash table is still continuous. However, close hashing may cause a manipulation time > $O(1)$ and provoke a sequential collision because of occupation.<br><br>

<b>Lazy removal</b><br>
If we want to remove some key in a bucket, we have to leave a remark on this bucket after remving this key in order to avoid losing all sequential keys. Because we wil mistake this bucket is empty if no remark is left.<br><br>

<b>Quadratic probing</b><br>
We prob next bucket in a quadratic number<br>
$$\begin{matrix} [hash(key) + 1^{2}] \% M \\ [hash(key) + 2^{2}] \% M \\ [hash(key) + 3^{2}] \% M \\ \vdots \end{matrix}$$

Quadratic probing is helpful to avoid collision cluster, mais may potentially increase I/O. Besides, here is another question, is it possible that some bucket is never visited by quadratic probing<br><br>

Suppose we have hash time with a lenghth M = 11. We can calculate all poosible bucket number by quadratic probing.
$$\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,...\}^{2} \% 11 = \{0, 1, 4, 9, 5, 3\}$$

We can observe first 6 ($\left \lceil \frac{11}{2} \right \rceil$) keys map to different address to each other and about 50% buckets are never visited.

</p>
<p align="justify">
<b>Proof by contradiction</b>: any two keys less than $\left \lceil \frac{M}{2} \right \rceil$ are different to each other.<br>
Assume $\exists$ a, b
$$0\leq a \lt b \lt \left \lceil \frac{M}{2} \right \rceil$$

We know $a^{th}$ and $b^{th}$ are in collision by duadratic probing.<br>
So
$$a^{2} \% M = b^{2} \% M$$

Then
$$(b^{2}-a^{2}) \% M = (b-a)(b+a) \% M = 0$$

According to number theory
$$0 \lt b-a \lt b+a < M$$

This is contrast with our hypothesis M is prime. Therefore, any two keys less than $\left \lceil \frac{M}{2} \right \rceil$ are different to each other.<br><br>

<b>Quadratic forward and backward probing</b><br>
We can use 2 probing, one is forward and the other is backward.
$$\begin{matrix} [hash(key) + 1^{2}] \% M\\ [hash(key) - 1^{2}] \% M\\ [hash(key) + 2^{2}] \% M\\ [hash(key) - 2^{2}] \% M\\ [hash(key) + 3^{2}] \% M\\ [hash(key) - 3^{2}] \% M\\ \vdots \end{matrix}$$

But for some prime number like 5, 13, forward chain and backward chain are compose of a same group of numbers, while other prime number like 7, 11 are not.

</p>
<p align="justify">
How to chose prime number M? It would be better $M = 4\times k + 3$, like 7, 11, 19, 23, ..... Why?<br><br>

Two-square Theorem of Fermat:<br>
Any prime number p can be equal to a sum of two integer's square, if and only if p % 4 = 1<br><br>

$$(u^{2}+v^{2})(s^{2}+t^{2}) = (us+vt)^{2}+(ut-vs)^{2}$$

$$(2^{2}+3^{2})(5^{2}+8^{2}) = (2\times5+3\times8)^{2}+(2\times8-3\times5)^{2}$$

We can infer, any natural number n can be equal to a sum of two integer's square if and only if each n's prime decomposition factors like $M = 4k + 3$ has a even power. For example
$$810 = 2 \times 3^{4} \times 5$$

810 has 3 prime factors: 2, 3, 5 where only 3 is like $M = 4k + 3$. At this time, 3 has a power of 4. Therefore, $810 = 27^{2} + 9^{2}$<br><br>

Now we have a prime number M = 4k + 3, assume there exist two different numbers a, b $\in [1, \left \lfloor \frac{M}{2} \right \rfloor]$ and $a^{2}$, $-b^{2}$ have a collision.
$$a^{2} \% M = -b^{2} \% M$$

$$(a^{2} + b^{2}) \% M = 0$$

According to the inference above, $n = a^{2} + b^{2}$ has a prime factor M with a format of 4k + 3, M's power is even, namely at least 2. In other word,
$$n \% M^{2} = 0$$

$$a^{2} + b^{2} \geq M^{2}$$

But this is impossible, so there is no such two integers a, b. In other word, forward and backward probing have no common bucket.
